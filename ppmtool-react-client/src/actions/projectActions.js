    The Redux store has a method called dispatch. 
    The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() and pass in an action object. 

    You can think of dispatching actions as "triggering an event" in the application. 
    Something happened, and we want the store to know about it. Reducers act like event listeners,
     and when they hear an action they are interested in, they update the state in response.

     State is Read-Onlyâ€‹
    The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action, an object that describes what happened.
